##ChurnChampion: Churn Prediction Modeling##

Overview :
ChurnChampion is a predictive modeling project focused on forecasting customer churn. This project aims to help businesses identify customers at risk of churn, enabling them to take preventive actions and improve retention rates.

The project includes:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning model training for churn prediction
A comprehensive Dash web app for visualizing model performance and feature importances

Features:
Churn Prediction Model: A machine learning model trained on customer data to predict the likelihood of churn.
Interactive Dashboard: A Dash app for visualizing model performance, feature importances, and data distributions.

Visualizations: Static and interactive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, including:
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve
Feature Importance Plot
Distribution of Monthly Charges by Churn

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChurnChampion.git
cd ChurnChampion
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the necessary Python libraries.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare the Data
Ensure that the raw customer data (customer_data.csv) is placed in the data/raw/ folder. If you don’t have this file, you may need to acquire the dataset and ensure it has the necessary features.

4. Run the Model Training (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model, use the notebooks/Modeling.ipynb notebook or execute the scripts in the src/ folder.

5. Start the Dash App
To visualize the results and insights, run the Dash app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the app locally, and you can access the dashboard by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser.

Usage
Once the Dash app is running, you can interact with the following visualizations:

Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into model performance by showing how many churn predictions were correct.
ROC Curve: Displays the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates at various threshold settings, including the AUC score.
Feature Importances: Shows the most important features used by the model to make churn predictions.
Churn Distribution: Displays the distribution of customer charges across different churn outcomes.
These visualizations help you evaluate the model and understand which factors contribute most to customer churn.

Dependencies
Python 3.8+
Dash
Pandas
Plotly
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib
To install all dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Future Work
Improve the model with advanced techniques (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature selection).
Add more visualizations and analysis to the dashboard.
Implement a real-time system for churn prediction.
